- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m bi3her, a highschooler interested in programming mainly as a hobby
- ðŸ‘€ I currently make Discord Bots using JDA.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, CSS and HTML so I can continue making a website that I've been struggling with making alone.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me via Discord @ bi3her#2159, that is if you want a Discord Bot or if you have recommendations on website developement.
